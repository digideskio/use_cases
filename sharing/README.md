# Sharing or embedding your project metrics

Since GrimoireLab uses [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) for visualization, you can use [its sharing and embedding features](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html#sharing-dashboards)

## How to share or embed your GrimoireLab dashboard

To share a dashboard, click the `Share` button ![Share button icon](imgs/share-dashboard.png) to display the Sharing panel.

To embed it, click the `Copy to Clipboard` button ![Copy link](imgs/share-link.png) to copy the embed HTML in `Embed this dashboard` to paste it in the html source where you want to embed it.

Click the `Generate short URL` button ![Generate short URL button](imgs/share-short-link.png) to create a shortened URL for sharing or embedding.

# Analysis of the Xen code review process

We have analyzed the code review process in the Xen project, using [MetricsGrimore](http://metricsgrimoire.github.io). These are the instructions for doing a similar analysis with [GrimoireLab](http://grimoirelab.github.io). The software and notes for the first study are available in the [xen-code-review-analysis repo](https://github.com/dicortazar/xen-code-review-analysis). A great part of the work done for this porting to GrimoireLab is done as an Outreachy project, whcih can be followed in part at [the corresponding GitHub repo](https://github.com/priya299/outreachy-project) (check issues).
